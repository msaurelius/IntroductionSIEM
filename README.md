#  SIEM
## Structure of repo
In this repo there will be focus on the room "Introduction to SIEM" from THM.
Beside the content that THM offers I would like to show my understanding by creating a summary.
Feel free to read only the summary yet the 2 files (Theory-of-SIEM and Static-Lab) shows that I could apply the theory in a LAB.

## What is SIEM?
SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management system. It is a tool that collects data from various endpoints/network devices across the network, stores them at a centralized place, and performs correlation on them. This room will cover the basic concepts required to understand SIEM and how it works.
