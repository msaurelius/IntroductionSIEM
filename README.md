#  Box: Introduction to SIEM
## What is SIEM?
SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management system. It is a tool that collects data from various endpoints/network devices across the network, stores them at a centralized place, and performs correlation on them. This box will cover the basic concepts required to understand SIEM and how it works.

## Structure of repo(based on box)
The box is divided into 2 sections:
1. Theory
   - Network visibility through SIENM
   - Log Sources and Log Ingestion
   - Why SIEM?
   - Analyzing logs and reports
2. Static-lab
   - Click on Start Suspicious Activity, which process caused the alert?
   - Find the event that caused the alert, which user was responsible for the process execution?
   - What is the hostname of the suspect user?
   - Examine the rule and the suspicious process; which term matched the rule that caused the alert?
   - What is the best option that represents the event?
   - Selecting the right ACTION will display the FLAG. What is the FLAG?
